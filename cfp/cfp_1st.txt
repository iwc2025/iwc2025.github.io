The 14th International Workshop on Confluence (IWC 2025), co-located
with WST 2025, aims at promoting further research in confluence and
related properties. Confluence provides a general notion of
determinism and has always been conceived as one of the central
properties of rewriting. In fact, confluence relates to many topics of
rewriting and computation in general (completion, modularity,
termination, commutation, etc.) and has been investigated in many
formalisms of rewriting such as first-order rewriting, lambda-calculi,
higher-order rewriting, constrained rewriting, conditional rewriting,
etc. Recently there is a renewed interest in confluence research,
resulting in new techniques, tool support, certification as well as
new applications. The workshop aims at promoting further research in
confluence and related properties.
 
## TOPICS
 
IWC 2025 encourages submissions in the following areas:
 
- confluence and related properties:
  unique normal forms, commutation, ground confluence
- completion
- critical pair criteria
- decidability issues
- complexity issues
- certification
- applications of confluence
 
The objective of this workshop is to bring together theoreticians and
practitioners to promote new techniques and results, and to facilitate
feedback on the implementation and application of such techniques and
results in practice. IWC 2025 also aims to be a forum for presenting
and discussing work in progress, and therefore to provide feedback to
authors on their preliminary research. More information can be found
on the webpage of the conference:

## SUBMISSIONS

We solicit short papers or extended abstracts of at most 5 pages in
EasyChair style, excluding references. There will be no formal
reviewing. In particular, we welcome short versions of recently
published articles and papers submitted elsewhere. The program
committee checks relevance and may provide additional feedback. The
accepted papers will be made available electronically before the
workshop. Short papers or extended abstracts must be submitted
electronically through the EasyChair system at:

   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwc2025
